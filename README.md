# NLP_Teewts_Analysis

Welcome to the Chat GPT Sentiment Analysis of Tweets Project! In this repository, you will find the code and resources necessary to perform a comprehensive analysis of sentiments expressed in tweets related to Chat GPT, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to analyze how the Twitter community perceives and reacts to the topic of Chat GPT, an artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI. To accomplish this, we have undertaken a multi-stage process, with each stage focused on a specific task:

1. **Data Import and Pre-processing**: We begin by importing relevant tweet data through the Twitter API or by downloading a pre-collected dataset. Next, we perform meticulous pre-processing to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

2. **Topic Modelling**: We implement topic modeling techniques to identify the most relevant themes that users are discussing in relation to Chat GPT. This will provide us with an overview of the key areas of interest within the community.

3. **Bag of Words**: We employ the "Bag of Words" approach to represent tweets as numerical vectors. This allows us to apply machine learning algorithms to classify and analyze the sentiments expressed in the texts.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We conduct an exploratory data analysis to gain deeper insights into the characteristics of tweets and any emerging patterns. This will help us to extract meaningful insights before proceeding with sentiment analysis.

    4.1. **Likes vs Retweets**: We compare the relationship between likes and retweets received by tweets related to Chat GPT. This will provide us with an understanding of how the audience engages and responds to this particular topic.

    4.2. **Tweets per day / Tweets per month**: We analyze the temporal distribution of tweets to identify whether there are specific events or moments when Chat GPT is discussed more frequently.

5. **Sentiment Analysis with Roberta**: We employ the pre-trained model Roberta to conduct sentiment analysis. Roberta is a powerful NLP model that allows us to classify tweets into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.
